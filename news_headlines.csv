He has bulldozed past the courts to impose his will on immigration policy and exact retribution on law firms and universities.
Conservative media outlets have backed him and his agenda, and some mainstream news organizations have been cowed.
It is a new challenge for Mr. Trump, who has always had a knack for cowing and humiliating rivals and using social media and the soft and hard powers of the presidency to steamroll any opposition.
Mr. Musk, who owns X and has 220 million followers, can match or arguably exceed Mr. Trump’s volume on social media, given the limited reach of Truth Social, the president’s own platform."

The episode marks a highly unusual use of the Energy Department’s emergency powers under the Federal Power Act.
In the past, the department has typically issued emergency orders at the request of regional grid operators to stabilize the power supply during extreme weather events and blackouts.
Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, said he estimated that the 90-day order to keep the coal plant open would cost ratepayers tens of millions of dollars.
“The grid operator wasn’t asking for this plant to be kept online."

In the past, the mine has been embroiled in allegations involving bribery, cocaine trafficking, firearms violations and the faked kidnapping of an executive.
The administration’s decision would extend the life of the Bull Mountain coal mine, which employs 250 people outside Billings, by nine years, the Interior Department said.
It would allow the mine’s operator, Signal Peak Energy, to mine nearly 60 million tons of coal, mostly for export to Asia.

Do not let others steer the ship off course and jeopardize the relationship.

Resignation because several African nations were previously banned during Mr. Trump’s first term, including Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.
Anger because they were unsure what African governments could do to get the ban lifted, if it would lead to family separations and how exactly each country landed on the list in the first place.

Employers added 139,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department reported on Friday, about in line with economists’ expectations.
And there are signs that President Trump’s chaotic economic policy has deterred hiring in parts of the economy that depend on imports.

The Verge,OpenAI is storing deleted ChatGPT conversations as part of its NYT lawsuit,https://www.theverge.com/news/681280/openai-storing-deleted-chats-nyt-lawsuit,2025-06-06T10:36:32-04:00,"OpenAI says it’s forced to store deleted ChatGPT conversations “indefinitely” due to a court order issued as part of The New York Times’ copyright lawsuit against it.
It won’t affect ChatGPT Enterprise or ChatGPT Edu customers, or businesses that have a zero data retention agreement.
OpenAI adds that the data won’t be public, and “only a small, audited OpenAI legal and security team” will be able to access the stored information for legal purposes.
The publication argues that saving user data could help preserve evidence to support its case.
“We will fight any demand that compromises our users’ privacy; this is a core principle.” The New York Times declined to comment."

“A child might [even] have friendships, but there could be issues in the relationships, where the child feels excluded, alienated, isolated, sad, or bored.
“It doesn’t necessarily mean the child is lonely — people have different social batteries.

“Your role is not to secure convictions at all costs, nor to satisfy public clamor, nor to advance political agendas,” the judge, André M. Espinosa, said in a rare and harshly worded rebuke of the U.S. attorney’s office that Ms. Habba leads and where he once worked as a prosecutor.
“An arrest, particularly of a public figure, is not a preliminary investigative tool,” he added.
“It is a severe action, carrying significant reputational and personal consequences, and it should only be undertaken after a thorough and dispassionate evaluation of credible evidence.”He dismissed the misdemeanor-level charge with prejudice, meaning that prosecutors could not decide to refile the same claim.
Mr. Trump tapped Ms. Habba, his personal lawyer, to serve as the U.S. attorney for New Jersey two months after he took office for the second time, an appointment that underscored the president’s tightening grip over a Justice Department he claimed had been weaponized against him."

The Verge,Epic is making it easier to create MetaHumans,https://www.theverge.com/news/678403/epic-games-metahumans-unreal-engine,2025-06-03T10:02:15-04:00,"Epic Games’ hyperrealistic MetaHuman characters are seriously impressive, and now the company is making it easier for developers to incorporate them into their projects.
At its State of Unreal show on Tuesday, Epic announced that the MetaHuman Creator is now embedded within Unreal Engine as part of Unreal Engine 5.6.
The company is also bringing its face-authoring tools for MetaHumans’ faces to bodies, meaning developers will be able to create faces and bodies with fine-tuned parameters for their games or applications.
Onstage, Epic showed how the MetaHuman tools could be used to animate a character in real time — and using just a consumer webcam to capture the actor’s facial movements.
Epic also has new licensing options that allow MetaHumans to be used with other game development engines or creative software."

The new Philips Hue Play Smart Wall Washer also casts an ambient glow on walls that can be synced to music and videos, but illuminates a wider area with better color output than its predecessor, thanks to “precisely arranged LEDs.”The Hue Wall Washer appears to be a significant upgrade over the Light Bar, but it’s considerably more expensive, too.
The Light Bar is currently on sale for $69.99 (normally $89.99) or available in a two-pack for $159.99, while a single Wall Washer unit is £199.99, or around $270, according to Hueblog.
The Philips Hue Play Smart Wall Washer uses colored LEDs angled upwards to increase the coverage of its illumination.
The Wall Washer is twice as bright as its predecessor but two lights can still be paired for even illumination on either side of a TV."
